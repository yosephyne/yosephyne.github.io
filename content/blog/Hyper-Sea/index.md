## Photo Modeling for Tarlie Lumby

I had the opportunity to work as a photo model for director Tarlie Lumby in the *Hyper Sea* project. This student project took place in Karpaz, Northern Cyprus, and was part of the performance department at [GAU Girne American University](https://www.gau.edu.tr/en). The performance explored themes of movement, environment, and expression within the context of performance art.

Here are some images from the project:
