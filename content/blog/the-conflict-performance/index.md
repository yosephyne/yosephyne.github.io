## The Conflict: Final Performance Project

This project, titled *The Conflict*, was my final performance piece during my exchange semester at the [GAU American University](https://www.gau.edu.tr/en) in Cyprus, specifically within the PERA (Performing Arts) department. The performance explores the theme of communication and conflict, visually represented in the choreography.

Inspired by a similar performance from the Dutch National Ballet's Contemporary Dance Theater, *The Conflict* highlights the complexities of human interaction and misunderstanding, brought to life through contemporary dance.

Here is the video of the performance:
