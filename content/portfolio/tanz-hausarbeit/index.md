## Resilience and Cultural Identity through Dance

This study examines the role of dance as an expression of resilience and cultural identity, focusing on the Greek-Turkish border crossing in Cyprus. The artistic work was conceptualized through video, planned photographically and textually, and interpreted through written reflection.

### Dance as a Medium for Cultural Identity and Resilience

Dance often serves as a means of preserving and strengthening cultural identity. Studies, such as those by Kroeber and Kluckhohn (1952), demonstrate how dance incorporates ritual and symbolic elements that reinforce cultural ties and historical consciousness. In the context of this work, video and film are used as communicative tools that can promote intercultural understanding and solidarity. For those who have experienced displacement, dance is seen as an act of resilience and a means of holding onto one’s cultural heritage.

### Dance as a Creative Expression of Trauma and Healing

The connection between dance, emotional states, trauma, and healing has been widely explored. In their study on dance therapy for trauma survivors, Van der Kolk et al. (2016) emphasize how creative expression through dance can aid trauma processing, acting as a release for emotional tensions and promoting self-healing. In this video storyboard, the girl's dance represents both an expression of her trauma and a pathway toward coping and healing.

### Dance as a Universal Language and Bridge

Dance is a universal form of communication that transcends language and cultural barriers, as highlighted by researchers like Cross et al. (2011). In the context of displacement, dance in this video storyboard is a form of communication between different cultures and individuals, building bridges and fostering understanding, even where verbal communication may be limited.

This research illustrates how the girl’s dance in the video storyboard transcends mere aesthetics, carrying deep cultural, emotional, and social significance. Her movements symbolize resilience, trauma processing, and a universal language of expression amidst experiences of displacement.
