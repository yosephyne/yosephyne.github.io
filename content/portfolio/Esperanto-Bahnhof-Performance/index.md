## Performance at Esperanto Bahnhof

In this performance, I collaborated with artist [Sasha Amaya](https://sashaamaya.com/) at *Esperanto Bahnhof* in Brandenburg, Germany. The production was organized and overseen by Falk Grever. The performance explored themes of space, movement, and communication in an unusual setting.

Here are some photos from the event:
