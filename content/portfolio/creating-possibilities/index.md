## Creating Possibilities: Solo Performance at Tanzfabrik Berlin

I had the opportunity to participate in a performance project at [Tanzfabrik Berlin](https://www.tanzfabrik-berlin.de/), under the guidance of Eva Georgitsopoulou. The project, titled *Creating Possibilities*, allowed me to explore and express new forms of movement and creativity.

As part of this workshop, I performed a solo piece that explored themes of personal expression and possibility within a structured improvisation framework.
